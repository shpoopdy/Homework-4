## Problem 1

Description: To practice using string search functions and arrays in PHP

This homework consists of two problems. PHP files and URL must be submitted.

Write a PHP script named findstates.php that creates a variable $states with the value “California Georgia Indiana Louisiana Minnesota Texas Virginia”. Perform each of the following tasks:

1. Search for a word in $states that ends in nia. Store this word in element 0 of an array named $statesArray1
2. Search for a word in $states that begins G and ends in a. Store this word in element 1 of $statesArray1
3. Display the contents of $statesArray1 to the screen.
4. Create a new array $statesArray2 that contains the contents of $statesArray1 in addition to the states West Virginia,
   North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Mexico and New Jersey.
5. Output the number of states in $statesArray2
6. Search $statesArray2 for the states that begin with the letter N or ends with nia and store them to the variable $statesArrayNia.
7. Display the contents of $statesArrayNia  to the screen.

 

## Problem2 //Random Sentence Generator

`$noun = array('boy', 'girl','cow', 'watermelon', 'Samsung Note', 'tree', 'tractor', 'iPhone', 'car', 'chicken', 'pen', 'chair', 'potato');

$verb = array('kissed', 'fried', 'dropped', 'wrote with', 'called on', 'chopped', 'fed', 'sat on', 'skinned', 'exploded', 'drove', 'ruined');`

 

Using the noun and verb declarations above, create a PHP Script sentence_gen.php that holds two arrays (nouns and verbs) to printout a simple sentence with the structure
